Skin Cancer Detection System
A Deep Learning-based Skin Cancer Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify skin cancer images into seven categories with a GUI interface.

---

📌 Project Overview
This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to classify skin cancer images based on the HAM10000 Dataset. It provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter to allow users to upload images and get real-time predictions.
